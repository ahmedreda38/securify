XSS vulnerabilities occur when untrusted input executes malicious JavaScript code, leading to issues such as account compromise and sensitive information leakage. To prevent this vulnerability, validate the user input, perform contextual output encoding or sanitize the input. In PHP you can encode or sanitize user input with `htmlspecialchars` or use automatic context-aware escaping with a template engine such as Latte."
